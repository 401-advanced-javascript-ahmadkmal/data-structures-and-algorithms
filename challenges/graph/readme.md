# Graphs
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices (also called nodes or points), together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph. These pairs are known as edges (also called links or lines), and for a directed graph are also known as arrows. The vertices may be part of the graph structure, or may be external entities represented by integer indices or references.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
write a class for graph data structure

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
AddNode()
Adds a new node to the graph
Takes in the value of that node
Returns the added node
AddEdge()
Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
Include the ability to have a “weight”
Takes in the two nodes to be connected by the edge
Both nodes should already be in the Graph
GetNodes()
Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)
GetNeighbors()
Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node
Takes in a given node
Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection
Size()
Returns the total number of nodes in the graph
